Using a short protocol adapted for clinical studies at 1.6 mm isotropic resolution, we measured magnetisation transfer ratio (MT), effective proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) in six healthy participants with three repetitions. 

We calculated the intra-subject and inter-subject reliability of each map in every region of the Neuromorphometrics atlas. 

The intra-subject reliability data can be seen here: [intra-subject reliability](/intra-subject.html) 

The inter-subject reliability data can be seen here: [inter-subject reliability](/inter-subject.html)

You can download all the reliability data as well as the mean parameter values using the link on the left.
