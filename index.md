Using a short protocol adapted for clinical studies at 1.6 mm isotropic resolution, we measured magnetisation transfer ratio (MT), effective proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) in six healthy participants with three repetitions. 

We calculated the intra-subject and inter-subject reliability of each map in every region of the Neuromorphometrics atlas. 

The intra-subject (scan-rescan) reliability data can be seen here: [intra-subject reliability](/intra-subject.html) 

The inter-subject reliability data can be seen here: [inter-subject reliability](/inter-subject.html)

Additionally we assessed the intra-subject reliability of one subject scanned three times at multiple resolutions. The data for this analysis can be seen here: [multi-resolution analysis](/multi-resolution.html)

You can download all the reliability data, mean parameter values, the multi-resolution analysis results, the bash scripts for MPM map creation using the hMRI toolbox as well as the scan protocol using the link on the left.
