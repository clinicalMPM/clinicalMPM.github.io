Using a short protocol adapted for clinical studies at 1.6 mm isotropic resolution, we measured magnetisation transfer ratio (MT), effective proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) in six healthy participants with three repetitions. 

MT, PD, R1 and R2* were then calculated in four different ways: 

1. B1+ inhomogeneities were corrected using acquired B1+ maps
2. B1+ inhomogeneities were corrected using a data-driven solution
3. B1+ inhomogeneities were corrected using acquired B1+ maps and the raw data was corrected for Gibb's ringing
4. B1+ inhomogeneities were corrected using a data-driven solution and the raw data was corrected for Gibb's ringing

We then calculated the intra-subject and inter-subject reliability of each map in every region of the Neuromorphometrics atlas. 

The intra-subject reliability data can be seen here: [intra-subject reliability](/intra-subject.html) 

The inter-subject reliability data can be seen here: [inter-subject reliability](/inter-subject.html)
