# Multi-resolution Analysis

The table below shows the intra-subject CoV of MT, PD, R1 and R2* values in the white matter at different isotropic resolutions (2.7 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.6 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.0 mm). All quantitative maps were corrected for B1+ inhomogeneities using an acquired B1+ map. The intra-subject CoV with and without correcting for Gibb's ringing is presented for each quantitative map and resolution.
